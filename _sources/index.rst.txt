Brno Mars Rover Documentation
================================================

You're reading a *living documentation* of a Brno Mars Rover Documentation.
This documentation *should* reflect the current state of things, but if you're unsure, ask the person responsible for the respective component.

By the nature of the rover development phase, this documentation is by no means a reference to the final product. Please keep that in mind and ask whenever you feel like you need more context.

The :ref:`introduction` page gives you a brief overview about our mission & the team.
If you're planning to work with us, or you've seen us somewhere and you're curious what the heck is this all about,
this is the place to get the basic understanding of who we are and what are we trying to achieve.

If you're new to the team, it is strongly recommended to read the :ref:`onboarding` page.
This page contains all the basic information you might need - from setting up our communication channels, to where the rover development takes place and how to access the lab.

If you're looking for something specific, below is the automatically generated table of contents.
